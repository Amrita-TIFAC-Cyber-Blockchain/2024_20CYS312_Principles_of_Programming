## Assignment - 02: Implementation of Language Parser using Haskell

- Date of Start: ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-gray)
- Date of Submission: ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TBD-gray) 
  
### Objective:
Design and implement a parser in Haskell for a programming language of your choice: C, C++, Python, or Java. The parser should be able to analyze and process the syntax of the chosen language, identifying and extracting key elements such as variables, functions, control structures, and data types. Your parser should be capable of handling a representative subset of the language's syntax.

#### Assignment Components:

- **Language Choice:** Select one of the following programming languages - C, C++, Python, or Java.

- **Parser Implementation:** Develop a parser in Haskell that can analyze the syntax of the chosen language. The parser should be able to handle a significant subset of the language's features.

- **Syntax Elements:** The parser should be capable of recognizing and processing key syntax elements, including but not limited to:
  - Variables and data types
  - Functions and methods
  - Control structures (e.g., if statements, loops)
  - Declarations and assignments
  - Error Handling: Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to deal with syntax errors in the input code.

- **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation for your Haskell parser, including instructions on how to run it and examples of valid and invalid input code.

- **Testing:** Develop a set of test cases to validate the correctness and effectiveness of your parser. Include test cases that cover various aspects of the chosen language's syntax.

- **Report:** Write a comprehensive report discussing the design decisions, challenges faced, and lessons learned during the implementation of the parser. Include sample input code snippets and corresponding parser outputs in your report.

#### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your Haskell source code along with any necessary files for running the parser.
- Include a README file with instructions on how to compile and run your parser.
- Submit the report in a separate document (PDF or Markdown).
- Note: While you are encouraged to explore additional features and improvements beyond the basic requirements, make sure to prioritize the core functionality of parsing the chosen language's syntax.
