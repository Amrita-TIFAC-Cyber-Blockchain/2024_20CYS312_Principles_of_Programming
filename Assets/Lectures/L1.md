## Programming Paradigm

### Imperative Programming
Imperative programming focuses on describing the steps that a program should take to reach a specific state. <br/>
**Key Concepts:** Variables, assignment statements, loops, and conditional statements.
- **Procedural Programming** organizes code into procedures or routines, with an emphasis on procedures that operate on data.
- **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** is based on the concept of "objects," which encapsulate data and behavior. It involves the use of classes and objects to model real-world entities. **Key Concepts:** Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Declarative Programming 
Declarative programming emphasizes what the program should accomplish without specifying how to achieve it. It expresses the logic of computation without describing control flow.
- **Logic Programming** involves defining relations and rules in the form of logical statements.
- **Functional Programming** treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. **Key Concepts:** First-class functions, immutability, and higher-order functions.
- **Event-Driven Programming** revolves around the handling of events, such as user actions or system notifications, and responding to them with appropriate code.
