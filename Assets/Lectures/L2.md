Let us look into the example for filtering the Roll Numbers of 21CYS batch using Imperative and Functional Paradigms.

#### Imperative Approach
```
def filter_roll_numbers_procedural(roll_numbers):
    result = []
    for roll_number in roll_numbers:
        if roll_number.startswith("CBENU4CYS21") and roll_number[12:].isdigit():
            result.append(roll_number)
    return result

roll_numbers = ["CBENU4CYS21001", "CBENU4CYS21090", "CBENU4CYS22002", "CBENU4CYS22065"]
result_procedural = filter_roll_numbers_procedural(roll_numbers)
print(result_procedural)
```

#### Functional Approach
```
def is_valid_roll_number(roll_number):
    return roll_number.startswith("CBENU4CYS21") and roll_number[12:].isdigit()

def filter_roll_numbers_declarative(roll_numbers):
    result = filter(is_valid_roll_number, roll_numbers)
    return list(result)

roll_numbers = ["CBENU4CYS21001", "CBENU4CYS21090", "CBENU4CYS22002", "CBENU4CYS22065"]
result_declarative = filter_roll_numbers_declarative(roll_numbers)
print(result_declarative)
```

### Side Effects
#### Imperative Approach
```
def filter_roll_numbers_with_side_effects(roll_numbers):
    valid_roll_numbers = []
    for roll_number in roll_numbers:
        if roll_number.startswith("CBENU4CYS21") and roll_number[12:].isdigit():
            valid_roll_numbers.append(roll_number)
    # Modifying a global variable is a side effect
    global filtered_roll_numbers
    filtered_roll_numbers = valid_roll_numbers

roll_numbers = ["CBENU4CYS21001", "CBENU4CYS21090", "CBENU4CYS22002", "CBENU4CYS22065"]
filtered_roll_numbers = ["CBENU4CYS21018"]
filter_roll_numbers_with_side_effects(roll_numbers)
print(filtered_roll_numbers)
```

#### Functional Approach
```
def is_valid_roll_number(roll_number):
    return roll_number.startswith("CBENU4CYS21") and roll_number[12:].isdigit()

def filter_roll_numbers_without_side_effects(roll_numbers):
    # Using filter without modifying external state
    result = list(filter(is_valid_roll_number, roll_numbers))
    return result

roll_numbers = ["CBENU4CYS21001", "CBENU4CYS21090", "CBENU4CYS22002", "CBENU4CYS22065"]
filtered_roll_numbers = filter_roll_numbers_without_side_effects(roll_numbers)
print(filtered_roll_numbers)
```
